# Logarithmic scale


In some cases, data can span several orders of magnitude, making it difficult to visualize on a linear scale. A logarithmic scale can help by compressing the data so that it's easier to understand.

```py
log_scale([1, 10, 100, 1000], 10)
# Output: [0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0]

log_scale([1, 2, 4, 8], 2)
# Output: [0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
```
