# Data Structures and Algorithms


What is a Data Structure?

They are just organized tools that allow for more advanced algorithms.
We already know some like Lists,Dictionaries and Sets.

What is a Algorithm?

Its a set of instructions getting carried out to solve a problem.

In context of computer science, an algorithm is a finite well defined, computer-implementable instructions.  In short:

Defined: there is a specific sequence of steps that performs a task
Unambiguous: there is a "correct" and "incorrect" interpretation of the steps
Implementable: it can be executed using software and hardware
