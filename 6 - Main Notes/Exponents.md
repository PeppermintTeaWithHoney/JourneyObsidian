# Exponents


An Exponent is just indicates how often a number should be multiplied by itself. So for example 3^3 is just 3x3x3 which is 27. Or 5^3 = `5 * 5 * 5` = `125

Every number ^1 is just the number it was before and every number ^0 is just 1.

And exponents grow very large, very quickly.

## Non-Linear Growth

The doubling formula 2*x grows linear or also called straight growth.

The quadratic formula x^2 grows faster and faster. 

What does this have to do with code?

Sometimes that's are a lot of computations(CPU utilization, slowness)
Sometimes that's a lot of memory usage (RAM)
Sometimes that's a lot of storage requirement  (SSD/HDD)
