# Queues



A queue stores items similar to a list, but similar restrictive like a stack. You can only add from the tail and remove from the head.

It has 3 main operations. Enqueue, adding a thing to the tail. Dequeue removing a item from the front of the Queue and Peek, which allows you to loom at a item on the head of the Queue.
