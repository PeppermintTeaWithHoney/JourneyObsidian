# The Rust Compiler

Source Code is the code that developers write.
Its meant to be readable by humans. 
The computer cannot understand the Rust code itself.

The Rust Compiler is a program that translates our source code into an executable program.
The executable program is called a binary or binary executable. 
The computer can understand and execute the instructions in the binary.
So we could think about the compiler like a translator.
