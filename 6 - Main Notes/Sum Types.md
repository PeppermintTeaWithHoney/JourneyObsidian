# Sum Types

As opposed to product types, sum types really can only have a fixed number of possible values. Sadly python doesn't really support sum types. So we have to do a little workaround. 

A product type is just is a just a product of 2 or more types.

# Enums


Enums (enumerations) are ==a user-defined data type in programming that represent a set of named, constant values==. They improve code readability by using meaningful names instead of arbitrary numbers and provide type safety. Enums are useful when a variable can only hold one of a fixed number of options, like days of the week or different status types.
