# Stacks

A stack is a data structure that stores ordered items. It only allows items to be added or removed from the top. Its really restrictive in that regard.

So why would we use something so restrictive? Speed.

Its blazingly fast, because we only interact with the item on top. 


All supported operations are O(1) by default. However,some tasks, like getitng to an item of the bottom of the stack have a higher time complexity.
