Starting with this chapter, we're going to focus on how we can store and organize data in a way that allows for even _better_ algorithms.

Data structures are just organizational tools that allow for more advanced algorithms. Some examples:

- **Stacks**: Last in, first out.
- **Queues**: First in, first out.
- **Linked Lists**: A chain of nodes, efficient for inserts and deletes.
- **Binary Trees**: A tree where each node has up to two children.
- **Red Black Trees**: A self-balancing binary tree using colors.
- **Hashmaps**: A data structure that maps keys to values.
- **Tries**: A tree used for storing and searching words efficiently.
- **Graphs**: A collection of nodes connected by edges.


# What Are Data Structures?

> A data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables _efficient_ access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

In other words, a data structure:

- Stores data
- Organizes data so that it can easily be accessed and modified
- Contains algorithmic functions to expose the ability to read and modify the data

You're already familiar with some of Python's built-in, simple data structures:

**List**: An ordered collection of items
